Note on patches
===============

This directory contains miscellaneous patches to Yocto that are needed for
building Pelux.

Patches must also be contributed upstream, and their existance in this
directory is temporary: once a patch has been accepted upstream and is not
needed in any subproject, it can be removed from here.

meta-bistro acts a data repository for the patches: their application is left
to the layer or project that actually needs them.
