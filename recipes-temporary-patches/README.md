Note on patches
===============

This directory contains temporary patches that are needed for building. In
particular, these are deemed needed when building PELUX (see http://pelux.io).

Patches must also be contributed upstream, and their existance in this
directory is temporary: once a patch has been accepted upstream and is not
needed in any subproject, it can be removed from here.

If you need to patch bitbake or any of the tools, or actually anything that is
not recipes or configuration, those patches will have to be applied manually,
but they would be stored here.
